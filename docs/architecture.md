# Architecture

## Runtime shape

The platform runs as three services in `docker-compose.yml`:

- **api** - Go HTTP API for world models, generation jobs, assets, status, provider checks, and event persistence
- **admin-web** - React admin UI built with Vite and served by NGINX
- **decoy-web** - Go HTTP service that serves generated files and forwards non-health access telemetry back to the API

Beyond these three fixed services, the API can spawn additional listeners for deployments — dedicated HTTP file servers, FTP servers, NFS servers, or SMB servers — each bound to its own port within the 9000–9020 range exposed by Docker Compose. FTP deployments also rely on a passive data-port range (`9011–9020` by default) within that published range when running behind Docker NAT.

## Request flow

1. A user opens the admin UI at `http://localhost:4173`.
2. The browser-safe default is for the UI to read API data through the admin container's same-origin NGINX `/api/*` proxy. `VITE_API_BASE_URL` only affects the built admin UI; direct tool clients should call the API URL themselves.
3. A generation run posts `world_model_id` to `POST /api/generation/run`.
4. The API:
   - loads the saved world model from SQLite
   - builds a deterministic asset manifest from that model
   - calls the configured external OpenAI-compatible provider once per manifest entry
   - renders content into HTML, Markdown, text, CSV, PDF, DOCX, or XLSX
   - writes files to shared storage
   - records asset and generation metadata in SQLite
5. The decoy service reads the generated files from the shared volume and serves them under `/generated/...`.
6. Every non-health decoy request is posted to `POST /internal/events` with `X-Honeygen-Internal-Event-Token`.
7. The admin UI reads those persisted events through `/api/status` and `/api/events`.

## Generation

The generation planner builds a deterministic asset manifest from the world model. In v1.1, the planner supports **file variation**: a pool of 16 document templates with style hints, driven by a seeded RNG so that repeated runs against the same world model produce diverse but reproducible output. World models can include `generation_settings` with `file_count_target` and `file_count_variance` to control the number of generated files per run.

Rendering now includes **DOCX** (pure Go) and **XLSX** (excelize/v2) alongside the existing HTML, Markdown, text, CSV, and PDF renderers. DOCX and XLSX assets are non-previewable, like PDFs.

## Deployments

Deployments serve generation job output on dedicated ports, managed by an in-process `DeploymentManager` within the API service. Each deployment binds a generation job's file tree to a port using one of the supported protocols:

- **HTTP** — `http.FileServer` serving the job's output directory
- **FTP** — `goftp/server/v2` exposing the files over FTP, configured with a public host/IP and passive port range so passive-mode listings/downloads work through Docker port publishing. Active-mode clients remain a poor fit behind Docker NAT on Windows.
- **NFS** — `go-nfs` providing NFSv3 access to the files
- **SMB** — Samba `smbd`, started as a managed subprocess with a per-deployment config and a read-only guest share named `honeygen`. Native Windows SMB clients cannot use this listener on localhost unless the service is reachable on port `445`, which Docker Desktop on Windows does not provide for this setup.

The same generation job output can be deployed across multiple protocols simultaneously. Every deployment protocol now feeds the same `POST /internal/events` pipeline, but each protocol contributes telemetry at its own natural granularity:

- **HTTP** emits `http_request` with full request/response metadata
- **FTP** emits `ftp_list` and `ftp_download`
- **NFS** emits `nfs_mount`, `nfs_list`, and `nfs_read`
- **SMB** emits `smb_connect`, `smb_disconnect`, `smb_opendir`, and `smb_open` by parsing Samba `full_audit` output

Non-HTTP deployment events normalize paths back to canonical `/generated/<world>/<job>/...` asset paths and include protocol metadata such as `deployment_id`, `protocol`, and `operation`. They do not have full HTTP-style fields like user agent or response status because those concepts are not available in the same way for FTP, NFS, or SMB.

Docker Compose exposes the port range 9000–9020 by default for deployment listeners.

## Storage

Two named volumes back the stack:

- `sqlite-data` -> SQLite database at `/app/storage/sqlite/honeygen.db`
- `generated-assets` -> generated files under `/app/storage/generated`

The API stores file metadata in SQLite and file bytes on disk. The decoy service and admin container both mount the generated-assets volume read-only.

## Data paths

- persisted file paths are stored relative to the storage root, for example:

  ```text
  generated/northbridge-financial/<job-id>/public/about.html
  ```

- decoy URLs serve those files as:

  ```text
  /generated/northbridge-financial/<job-id>/public/about.html
  ```

- admin download links map the same file tree to `/downloads/...`, stripping the stored leading `generated/` prefix

## Seed/demo model

On first API startup, the world-model service seeds:

- id: `northbridge-financial`
- name: `Northbridge Financial Advisory`
- source file: `sample-data/world-models/northbridge-financial.json`

This gives a teammate a working demo baseline without creating a world model by hand.

## Service boundaries

### API

Owns:

- config loading
- SQLite migrations
- demo seed insertion
- provider test endpoint
- generation orchestration
- asset metadata and preview APIs
- event persistence and querying

### Admin web

Owns:

- dashboard
- world model CRUD UI
- generation controls
- asset tree and safe preview UI
- event log UI

NGINX also proxies `/api/*` to `api` and exposes `/downloads/*` as attachment-only file downloads from the generated asset volume.

### Decoy web

Owns:

- `/healthz`
- landing page at `/`
- direct generated file serving under `/generated/*`
- request telemetry forwarding back to the API

## Operational notes

- `api` and `decoy-web` must share the same `INTERNAL_EVENT_INGEST_TOKEN`.
- Provider mode is `external` only when `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and `LLM_MODEL` are all set.
- PDF rendering depends on `wkhtmltopdf` inside the backend image. DOCX and XLSX rendering are pure Go with no external dependencies.
- Persistence survives container restart as long as Compose volumes are kept.
